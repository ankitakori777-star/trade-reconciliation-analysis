Alteryx Validation Workflow Description

1. Input trade data from front-office and back-office sources
2. Apply mandatory field checks (Trade ID, Notional, Currency)
3. Apply business validation rules:
   - Notional difference > tolerance → Flag as break
   - Currency mismatch → Flag as break
   - Settlement date earlier than trade date → Flag as error
4. Classify breaks by type
5. Output exception report for reconciliation team
